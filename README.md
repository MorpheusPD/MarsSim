### Environments
- ```world.launch```: spawn world generated from cropped martian DTM + added populations of rocks of various size
- ```actor_long.launch```: spawn world and box with stereocamera and 3D LiDAR moving on a fixed closed path of ~300 meters
- ```actor_long_rocks.launch```: as before, but this time more rocks are present, some of them are big boulders
- ```actor_short.launch```: spawn world and box with stereocamera and 3D LiDAR moving on a short path of ~60 meters
