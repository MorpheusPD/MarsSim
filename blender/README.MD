The .blend file contains the world mesh and it can be used to generate new actor .sdf file.

There are two python scripts in the .blend file that can be run to generate a CSV with the ground truth and the actor sdf file. 


"toActorSDF" 
	Starting from an actor sdf template (containing the sdf of the actor), it generates a new sdf file with the waypoints of the blender path.
	Some adjustements may be needed to obtain a good path.


"toCSV"
