# Blender world model
The ```.blend``` file contains the world mesh and it can be used to generate ```.sdf``` files for the Gazebo actors.

## Scripts
To instruct the Gazebo actor and export a ground truth for further processing (e.g. Matlab), we provide the following scripts
- ```toActorSDF```:
adds to an existing sdf file the waypoints from the path generated in Blender

- ```toCSV```:
This script is used to generate the ground truth CSV file
